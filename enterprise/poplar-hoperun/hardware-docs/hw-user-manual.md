The UART module has the following features:
- A 16 x 8-bit TX FIFO and a 16 x 12-bit RX FIFO
-  Programmable widths of the data bit and stop bit. The width of the data bit can be set to 5 bits, 6 bits, 7 bits, or 8 bits and that of the stop bit can be set to 1 bit or 2 bits by programming.
- Parity check or no check
- Programmable transfer rate
- RX FIFO interrupts, TX FIFO interrupts, RX timeout interrupts, and error interrupts
- Query of the status of raw and masked interrupts
- UART disable or RX/TX disable by programming to reduce power consumption

### LED Indicators

The 96Boards Poplar board specifications calls for six LEDs to be implemented on the board.  The specification defines the LEDs color and mechanical location on the board. There are two status LEDs and four User LEDs on the Poplar board. The user LEDs can be programmed by the SoC directly.

<img src="../additional-docs/images/images-hw-user-manual/LED_Indicators.png?raw=true" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/enterprise/poplar-hoperun/additional-docs/images/images-hw-user-manual/LED_Indicators.png?raw=true" width="250" height="160" />

#### Four User-LED's

-  The four user LEDs are surface mount Green Type 0603 LED.

### GPIO

Hi3798C V200 supports 13 groups of GPIO pins, and each group provides eight programmable input/output pins. Each GPIO pin can be configured as an input or output. These pins are used to generate output signals or capture input signals for specific applications. As an input, each GPIO pin can act as an interrupt source; as an output, each GPIO pin can be separately set to 0 or 1.

The GPIO module has the following features:
-  Each GPIO pin can be set to input or output.
   - When a GPIO pin acts as an input pin, it can be used as the interrupt source. Each GPIO pin supports independent interrupt control.
   - When a GPIO pin acts as an output pin, it can be separately cleared or set to 1.
-  The GPIO interrupts are controlled by seven registers (such as GPIO_IS). These registers are used to specify the interrupt source, polarity, and interrupt edge (falling edge or rising edge). For details about the corresponding interrupt registers of the GPIO.
   -  When multiple interrupts are generated at the same time, these interrupts are combined as one interrupt and then reported.
   - The GPIO_IS, GPIO_IBE, and GPIO_IEV registers determine the features of the interrupt source and interrupt trigger type.
   -  GPIO_RIS and GPIO_MIS are used to read the raw interrupt status and masked interrupt status respectively. GPIO_IE controls the final report status of each interrupt. In addition, GPIO_IC is provided to clear the interrupt status.
