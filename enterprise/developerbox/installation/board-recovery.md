# System firmware recovery

This section outlines steps needed to recover your Developerbox from a
bricked software state. These instructions are suggested to those who
are experiences boot issues due to a corruption of the NOR FLASH.

In all other cases is it **strongly** recommended to use [Capsule
Update](README.md) instead.

## Update using serial flasher

The serial flasher can be enabled in two ways.

1. Turn the board off, set DSW2-7 to on and turn the board
   on again. The flasher program will be started automatically;
   don't forget to turn the switch off again after flashing.
2. Send a keypress to LS-UART0 shortly after turning on the
   power to the board and enter `update firmware` at the
   resulting command prompt. In some systems the timeout to
   enter the initial keypress is *very* short meaning it is best to
   send repeated keypresses commencing before you turn the board on
   (a.k.a. keyboard auto-repeat).

When the serial flasher is running correctly is will show the following
boot messages shown via LS-UART0:

~~~
/*------------------------------------------*/
/*  SC2A11 "SynQuacer" series Flash writer  */
/*------------------------------------------*/

Command Input >
~~~

Once the flasher tool is running we are ready flash the UEFI image:

~~~
flash rawwrite 180000 280000
>> Send SPI_NOR_IMAGE.fd-RELEASE via XMODEM (Control-A S in minicom) <<
~~~

## Resetting the NVRAM

Occasionally it is necessary to reset the platform's "NVRAM", a special
section on the NOR flash which holds the UEFI variable store.

The simplest way to reset the NVRAM is to set DSW3-1 to on and reboot
the system. Be sure to remember to set the switch back to the default
(off) position, before the next reboot!

Alternatively it is possible to wipe the varstore when updating the UEFI
image using the serial flasher, try (note the change if size, from 28000
to 2b0000, compared to a normal flash write operation):

~~~
flash rawwrite 180000 2b0000
>> Send SPI_NOR_IMAGE.fd via XMODEM (Control-A S in minicom) <<
~~~

# Low-level (CM3) firmware recovery

Very occasionally it may be required to update the low-level board
firmware, sometimes called the CM3 firmware).

## Update using serial flasher

Be aware that THE SERIAL FLASHER HAS THE CAPABILITY TO SOFT-BRICK YOUR
BOARD. In particular the implementation of the XMODEM protocol is easily
confused by extra keystrokes and runs *after* the FLASH has been erased.
For example sending *Control-A Control-S* rather than *Control-A S* from
minicom risks soft-bricking the board. It is possible to recovery a
soft-bricked board using a JTAG programmer (see below).

The serial flasher can be enabled in two ways.

1. Turn the board off, set DSW2-7 to on and turn the board
   on again. The flasher program will be started automatically;
   don't forget to turn the switch off again after flashing.
2. Send a keypress to LS-UART0 shortly after turning on the
   power to the board and enter `update firmware` at the
   resulting command prompt. In some systems the timeout to
   enter the initial keypress is *very* short meaning it is best to
   send repeated keypresses commencing before you turn the board on
   (a.k.a. keyboard auto-repeat).

When the serial flasher is running correctly is will show the following
boot messages:

~~~
/*------------------------------------------*/
/*  SC2A11 "SynQuacer" series Flash writer  */
/*------------------------------------------*/

Command Input >
~~~

Update the low-level firmware only when strictly necessary, and it
is recommended to always "practice" by updating the option ROM whether
or not it requires contains any changes!

~~~
flash write s-mir-cm3
>> Send option ROM via XMODEM <<
flash write p-master-cm3
>> Send new CM3 firmware via XMODEM <<
~~~

The current option rom is found in the system firmware sources:
`edk2-non-osi/Platform/Socionext/DeveloperBox/synquacer_eeprom_pcie0snoop_on_pcie1snoop_on` .

The currently recommended firmware is available seperately:
`ramfw_20171102.bin` (sha1sum: `6dad40f7d055346a7cd095ed432c677bf2509c8e`).

## JTAG recovery

The JTAG recovery process allows the serial flasher to be run from SRAM,
thus allowing the NOR to be updated.

To recovery the board you will need a suitable JTAG programmer. The
SC2A11 is interfaced using 1.8v TTL logic. Your programmer must support
1.8v signalling and, if the programmer supports powering the target
device, this feature **must** be disabled before you connect the
programmer to the board (many programmers provide a 3.3v power supply
and applying this voltage could damage the board).

These instructions assume you have a [Bus
Blaster](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Bus-Blaster-v3-p-1415.html) running
using a [KT-Link compatible
buffer](https://github.com/bharrisau/busblaster) and with the **power
supply jumper removed** (as discussed above). In the instructions below,
replace `interface/ftdi/dp_busblaster_kt-link.cfg` with whatever is
appropriate for your programmer.

Note: *If you have purchased a Bus Blaster device to perform the
recovery, it will not have been shipped with a KT-Link compatible buffer
(they are usually shipped with selftest firmware). To update the buffer,
try `git clone https://github.com/bharrisau/busblaster` followed by
`openocd -f board/dp_busblaster_v3.cfg -c "adapter_khz 1000; init; svf
synthesis/system.svf; shutdown"`*

Firstly we must create a configuration file to describe the board:

~~~
cat > sc2a11.cfg <<EOF
###########################################
set _CHIPNAME sc2a11
set _TARGETNAME \$_CHIPNAME.m3
adapter_khz 1000

if { [info exists ENDIAN] } {
   set _ENDIAN \$ENDIAN
} else {
   set _ENDIAN little
}

set _M3_JTAG_TAPID 0x6ba00477

jtag newtap auto0 tap -irlen 4 -expected-id 0x6ba00477

target create \$_TARGETNAME cortex_m -endian \$_ENDIAN -chain-position
auto0.tap
EOF
~~~

If your board was bricked by a failed attempt to update the CM3 firmware
then the flasher tool is still present in NOR but there is no bootloader
to launch it. Try:

~~~
openocd \
        -f interface/ftdi/dp_busblaster_kt-link.cfg \
        -f sc2a11.cfg \
        -c "init" \
        -c "reset halt" \
        -c "mwb 0x44100000 3" \
        -c "resume 0x8fe0050" \
        -c "exit"
~~~

Alternatively, if your NOR has been totally erased (this is unlikely,
but certainly possible) then you may have to load a flasher tool into
RAM:

~~~
openocd \
        -f interface/ftdi/dp_busblaster_kt-link.cfg \
        -f sc2a11.cfg \
        -c "init" \
        -c "reset halt" \
        -c "mwb 0x44100000 3" \
        -c "load_image flash-writer-maverick-evb-4bytemode.axf-cd59a5d"
\
        -c "resume 0x800051" \
        -c "exit"
~~~

Whichever approach is used, at this point the SC2A11 Flash writer should
be running on the CM3 console and NOR can be updated:

~~~
flash write s-mir-cm3
>> Send new option ROM via XMODEM <<
flash write p-master-cm3
>> Send new CM3 firmware via XMODEM <<
~~~
