# Install Over HTTP

The system firmware of your Developerbox includes a feature called `Ram
Disk Boot from HTTP`. This allows the system firmware to download an ISO
image containing a UEFI-compliant file system. The firmware is able to
boot from the ISO image and, additionally, the ISO image will be mounted
as a RAM disk by HTTP Boot driver, allowing the image to be used in the
subsequent boot process.

The system firmware is preconfigured to obtain a network address using
DHCP and even has boot configuration that can _Install Debian Stretch over HTTP_

 * Boot your Developerbox and press `Escape` to enter the EDK2 menu system

This will launch the installer. Further information on how to install
