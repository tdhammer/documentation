**IMPORTANT NOTES**

- HDMI EDID display data is used to determine the best display resolution. On monitors and TVs that support 1080p (or 1200p) this resolution will be selected. If 1080p is not supported the next available resolution reported by EDID will be used. This selected mode will work with **MOST but not all** monitors/TVs.
- There are limitations on the usage of the USB ports on the Bubblegum-96 board.

## Starting the board for the first time

**The Bubblegum-96 comes preloaded Android and can be up and running with a few simple steps:**

- Connect the Bubblegum-96 to your [display with the HDMI cable](). It is important to do this first because the monitor will not detect the board if it is connected after starting. Ensure that the source for the display is switched to the HDMI port you are using
- Connect the [USB keyboard and mouse](). Do not connect the USB OTG port to your computer – this will prevent the keyboard and mouse from operating. The USB OTG port is the micro USB connector on the board
- Connect the power supply to the Bubblegum-96.

Once you plug the power supply into a power outlet, the board will start the booting process. You should see Android boot up.

Please note, the first boot takes several minutes due to Androids initializations. Subsequent boot times should be faster after the first boot.
