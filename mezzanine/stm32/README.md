# 1) Introduction
## 1.1) About the 96Boards STM32 Sensor Mezzanine

The [96Boards STM32 Sensor Mezzanine](https://www.96boards.org/product/stm32/) board with STM32F446 MCU (B-F446E-96B01A) enables users to prototype systems that are aware of their environment, thanks to the embedded sensors for movement, pressure and sound. It can directly be plugged on top of the 96Boards CE cards and supports multiple expansion possibilities through the Arduino™ Uno Revision 3 or the Grove™connectivity. The integrated ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger facilitates software development, drag-and-drop programming and provides a direct access to the ARM®mbed™on-line resources.
