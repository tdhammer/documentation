# Getting Started

Learn about your BPi96 board as well as how to prepare and set up for basic use

## Setup - What you will need

- **Software**
  - PC Running Windows
  - [Arm Keil MDK](http://www2.keil.com/mdk5)
  - MDK5&STM32F1XX Package for Keil
- **Hardware**
  - [JLink Debugger](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/)
  - Power supply : Micro USB or 3.7V Li-ion

## Starting the board for the first time

**How to connect?**

JLink and BPI NB-IoT Linaro SWD mode connection:

**MDK5 “Options for Target” — “Debug” setting：**

First need to build the project file based on the corresponding chip, and in the Options of Target do the following settings

（Project file specific settings include but are not limited to the following settings）

（Development board needs to be kept powered）

**Debug method：**

1.	You can use the debug serial port (MCU USART1) to debug.

2.	Use Micro USB virtual serial port for debugging.
The above two methods require MCU program support

> Note：
1.	Debug serial port, SWD simulation interface spacing 2.54mm, GPIO pitch 2.0mm
2.	The LED next to the Micro USB is the power indicator, which should be on after any power-up.
 

## NB-IoT

This module needs to be used with NB_IOT SIM card.

Different carriers support different frequency bands，Module operating frequency band to distinguish the module model，such as：

- **Firmware version：**
  - Query firmware instructions：AT+CGMR
  - Result：V100R100C10B656SP2  firmware version is B656SP2
- **Scramble code function：**
  - The module is consistent with the base station.
- **SIM Card:**
  - The module can used two kinds of SIM card. Standard SIM card or eSIM card.
- **Antenna:**
  - The module has reserved the MHF WiFi antenna interface, which can be selected according to the actual usage of the product.
