# Support

Please take advantage of the many 4IoT resources available to you through 96Boards, MediaTek, and Coursera

- 96Boards 4IoT Forum
   - The DragonBoard has its very own 96Boards forum. If you can't find a pre-existing thread that addresses your issue, start your own and let the community help out!
- [Geniatech product page](https://www.geniatech.com/product/developer-board-4-iot/)
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/internet-of-things)
   - 4IoT uses the same specification! Students from the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) put together an "Internet of Things" (IoT) course focused around the DragonBoard 410c (again, same specification as 4IoT!). It is free to audit, or you can purchase the specialization package for a cool certificate!
- [Report a bug!](../../../Report_a_bug.md)
   - Instructions on how to report bugs for any of our 96Boards hardware and software, this includes the 4IoT!
